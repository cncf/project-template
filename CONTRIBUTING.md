Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project! üíñ

As you get started, you are in the best position to give us feedback on areas of
our project that we need help with including:

* Problems found during setting up a new developer environment
* Gaps in our Quickstart Guide or documentation
* Bugs in our automation scripts

If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a
bug report and let us know!

## Ways to Contribute

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/#ways-to-contribute)

We welcome many different types of contributions including:

* New features
* Builds, CI/CD
* Bug fixes
* Documentation
* Issue Triage
* Answering questions on Slack/Mailing List
* Web design
* Communications / Social Media / Blog Posts
* Release management

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request. Please come to our
[meetings](TODO) or [contact us](TODO) and let's discuss how we can work
together. 

### Come to Meetings

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/#come-to-meetings)

Absolutely everyone is welcome to come to any of our meetings. You never need an
invite to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you don‚Äôt have
anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You can find out more about our meetings [here](TODO). You don‚Äôt have to turn on
your video. The first time you come, introducing yourself is more than enough.
Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable voicing your opinions, giving
feedback on others‚Äô ideas, and even sharing your own ideas, and experiences.

## Find an Issue

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/#find-an-issue)

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable
for any contributor. [good first issue](TODO) has extra information to
help you make your first contribution. [help wanted](TODO) are issues
suitable for someone who isn't a core maintainer and is good to move onto after
your first pull request.

Sometimes there won‚Äôt be any issues with these labels. That‚Äôs ok! There is
likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you
don‚Äôt know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can ‚ö†Ô∏è **explain how people can ask for an issue to work on**.

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying
that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.

## Ask for Help

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/#ask-for-help)

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pick the way(s) that you prefer people ask for help**

* The original github issue
* The developer mailing list
* Our Slack channel

## Sign Your Commits

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/sign-your-commits)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep either the DCO or CLA section depending on which you use**

### DCO
Licensing is important to open source projects. It provides some assurances that
the software will continue to be available based under the terms that the
author(s) desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to
our project's repositories. The [Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) is a way to certify that you wrote and
have the right to contribute the code you are submitting to the project.

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must
match the git user and email associated with the commit.

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:

    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote
repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running 

    git commit --amend -s 

### CLA
We require that contributors have signed our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Explain how to sign the CLA**

## Pull Request Checklist

When you submit your pull request, or you push new commits to it, our automated
systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request
passes these checks, but we also have more criteria than just that before we can
accept and merge it. We recommend that you check the following things locally
before you submit your code:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Create a checklist that authors should use before submitting a pull request**
