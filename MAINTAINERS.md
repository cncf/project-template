The current Maintainers Group for the [TODO: Projectname] Project consists of:

| Name | Employer | Responsibilities |
| ---- | -------- | ---------------- |
|      |          |                  |

This list must be kept in sync with the [CNCF Project Maintainers list](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/project-maintainers.csv).

See [the project Governance](GOVERNANCE.md) for how maintainers are selected and replaced.
