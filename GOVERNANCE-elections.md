# Steering Committee Governance

This is an example governance document for projects that use steering committee
elections from the contributors at large.  See [GOVERNANCE.md](/GOVERNANCE.md)
for more information.  Thanks to the Kubernetes Project for portions of the text
below.

This is a template document for CNCF projects that requires editing
before it is ready to use. Read the markdown comments, `<!-- COMMENT -->`, for
additional guidance. The raw markdown uses `TODO` to identify areas that
require customization.  Replace [TODO: PROJECTNAME] with the name of your project.

<!-- template begins here-->

The [TODO: PROJECTNAME] Steering Committee is the governing body of the [TODO: PROJECTNAME] project,
providing decision-making and oversight pertaining to the project bylaws,
sub-organizations, and financial planning. The Steering Committee also defines
the project values and structure.

This governance  is an open, living document, and will continue to
evolve as the community and project change.

## Values

<!-- This is where you put the core values or principles of your project, like
openness, distributed design, fairness, diversity, etc.

References and Examples

* https://kubernetes.io/community/values/

See https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/governance/charter for guidance and
additional examples.  The values below are just example values as a jumping-off
point for your project's actual values.  -->

The [TODO: PROJECTNAME] and its leadership embrace the following values:

* Openness: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is discoverable for future
  reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public
  forums and open repositories.

* Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit
  contributions, which will be considered on their merits.

* Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes
  priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals.  Each
  contributor participates in the project as an individual.

* Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which
  can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.

* Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through
  participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership
  positions.


## Charter

The following responsibilities and powers belong to the Steering Committee.

Technical governance is expected to be performed by the Maintainers of the
various project areas and subprojects, as defined in the appropriate OWNERS files.

* Delegate ownership of, responsibility for and authority over areas of the
  project to specific entities.
* Define, evolve, and defend the vision, mission and the values of the project.
* Charter and refine policy for defining new community groups, and establish
  transparency and accountability policies for such groups
* Define and evolve project and group governance structures and policies.
* Act as a final escalation point for disputes in any project repository or
  group.
* Request funds and other support from the CNCF (e.g. marketing, press, etc.)
* Coordinate with the CNCF regarding usage of the [TODO: PROJECTNAME] brand and deciding
  project scope, core requirements, and conformance, as well as how that brand
  can be used in relation to other efforts or vendors.
* Decide, for the purpose of elections, who is a member of standing, and what
  privileges that entails.
* Control and delegate access to and establish processes regarding all project
  repositories, resources, and assets.
<!-- assumes a separate Code of Conduct Committee, which is expected for
 any project mature enough to need a Steering Committee-->
* Appointing the members of the Code of Conduct Committee in order to ensure
  responsiveness, diversity, and good judgement.

## Delegated authority

The Steering Committee may choose to delegate its authority to other committees
as-needed. The committee currently recognizes this delegated authority for:

- [TODO: List of Delegated Authorities]

<!-- Above put a list of powers of the SC that are being handled by some other
group or person.  For example, you may have a Marketing Committee that handles
all work with CNCF marketing, or a different body that handles escalated
technical disputes.-->

## Committee Meetings

The Steering Committee meets [TODO: frequency of meetings], or as-needed.
Meetings are held online, and are public by default.

Given the private nature of some of these discussions (e.g. privacy, private
emails to the committee, code of conduct violations, escalations, disputes
between members, security reports, etc.) some meetings are held in private.
<!-- consider setting up a cadence of private vs. public meetings here-->

Meeting notes are available to members of the
[developer mailing list](TODO).
Public meetings will be recorded and the recordings made available publicly.

Questions and proposals for changes to governance or community procedures are posted as
[issues in the community repo](TODO), and
the Steering Committee invites your feedback there. See
[Getting in touch](#getting-in-touch) for other options.

## Committee members

Seats on the Steering Committee are held by an individual, not by their
employer.

The current membership of the committee is currently (listed alphabetically by
first name):

| &nbsp;                                                         | Member           | Organization |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |


## Decision process

The Steering Committee desires to always reach consensus.

Decisions requiring a vote include: issuing written policy, amending existing
written policy, creating, removing, or modifying a working group, all spending,
hiring, and contracting, official responses to publicly raised issues, or any
other decisions that at least two of the members present decide require a vote.

Decisions are made in meetings when a quorum of more than half of the members
are present (and all members have been informed of the meeting), and may pass
with more than half the members of the committee supporting it.

## Getting in touch

There are two ways to raise issues to the steering committee for decision:

1. Emailing the Steering Committee at
   [steering@project.org](TODO).
   This is a private discussion list to which all members of the committee have
   access.
2. Open an issue on [the community repository](TODO) and indicate that you would like
   attention from the steering committee.

## Composition

The steering committee has [TODO: Number] seats. These seats are
open to any project contributor. See
[candidate eligibility](#candidate-eligibility) for a definition.

<!-- if doing staggered terms, which is recommended.  These are usually 2-year
terms.-->

Steering Committee members serve for [TODO: Service Period] terms, staggered in order to
preserve continuity. Every year either [TODO:Number] or [TODO:Remainder]
contributor seats are elected.

<!-- if doing elect-everyone-at-once terms, instead use:

Steering Committee members serve for [TODO: Service Period] terms, elected
every [TODO: Service Period]

-->

<!-- If you are starting from scratch, and need a transition period, but plan
to have staggered 2-year terms, we recommend the following:

For the first year of the Steering Committee, [TODO: Year], [TODO: Number] of the
seats will be elected for a 1-year term, and [TODO: Number] will be elected for
a 2-year term.

-->

## Election Procedure

### Timeline

Steering Committee elections are held annually. Six weeks or more before the
election, the Steering Committee will appoint Election Officer(s) (see below).
Four weeks or more before the election, the Election Officer(s) will issue a
call for nominations, publish the list of voters, and open the call for
exceptions. Three days before the election the call for nominations and exceptions
will be closed. The election will be open for voting not less than two weeks and
not more than four. The results of the election will be announced within one
week of closing the election. New Steering Committee members will take office on
[TODO: Date] of each year.

### Election Officer(s)

Six weeks or more before the election, the Steering Committee will appoint
between one and three Election Officer(s) to administer the election. Elections
Officers will be community members in good standing who are eligible to
vote, are not running for Steering in that election, who are not currently part
of the Steering Committee and can make a public promise of impartiality. They
will be responsible for:

- Making all announcements associated with the election
- Preparing and distributing electronic ballots
- Judging exception requests
- Assisting candidates in preparing and sharing statements
- Tallying voting results according to the rules in this charter

### Eligibility to Vote

Anyone who has at least [TODO:Number] contributions in the last 12 months is
eligible to vote in the Steering election. Contributions are defined as opening PRs,
reviewing and commenting on PRs, opening and commenting on issues, writing
design docs, commenting on design docs, helping people on community forums, participating
in working groups, and other efforts that help advance the project.

[This dashboard](TODO: Devstats link)
shows only GitHub based contributions and does not capture all the contributions
we value. We expect this metric not to capture everyone who should be eligible
to vote. If a community member has had significant contributions over the past
year but is not captured in Devstats,
they will be able to submit an exception form to the Elections Officer(s) who
will then review and determine whether this member should be eligible to vote.
All exceptions, and the reasons for them, will be recorded and saved by the
officers.

<!-- Note: CNCF will soon have a better, GitOps-driven, online election tool
available.  At that time, projects will want to revise this process. -->

The electoral roll of all eligible voters will be captured at [TODO: Github election
location] and the voters’ guide will
be captured at [TODO: Github Election info location],
similar to the
[Kubernetes election process](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/blob/master/elections.md).

We are committed to an inclusive process and will adapt future eligibility
requirements based on community feedback.

### Candidate Eligibility

Community members must be eligible to vote in order to stand for election (this
includes voters who qualify for an exception). Candidates may self-nominate or
be nominated by another eligible member. There are no term limits for Steering
Committee members. Nothing prevents a qualified member from serving on both Steering
and other groups simultaneously.

To run for a seat, a candidate must additionally be at least a
project Member as defined in
[ROLES.md](TODO: Link to your contributor ladder).

### Voting Procedure

<!-- Note: CNCF will be in a position to offer a more modern replacement for
CIVS by the end of 2021 -->
Elections will be held using a time-limited
[Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) ranking on
[CIVS](http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/) using the IRV method. The top
vote-getters will be elected to the open seats, with the exceptions for company
representation discussed below.

### Limitations on Company Representation

No more than [TODO: Number] seats may be held by employees of the same organization (or
conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other). If an
election results in greater than [TODO: Number] employees of the same organization being
selected, the lowest vote getters from any particular employer will be removed until
representation on the committee is down to two.

If employers change because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events, in a
way that would yield too many seats being held by employees of the same
organization, sufficient members of the committee must resign until only [TODO: Number]
employees of the same employer are left. If it is impossible to find sufficient
members to resign, all employees of that organization will be removed and new
special elections held. In the event of a question of company membership (for
example evaluating independence of corporate subsidiaries) a majority of all
non-involved Steering Committee members will decide.

## Vacancies

In the event of a resignation or other loss of an elected SC member, the
candidate with the next most votes from the previous election will be offered
the seat, provided that person otherwise qualifies to join the SC. This process
will continue until the seat is filled.

In case this fails to fill the seat, a special election for that position will
be held as soon as possible, unless the regular SC election is less than 7 weeks
away. Eligible voters from the most recent election will vote in the special
election. Eligibility will not be redetermined at the time of the special
election. Any replacement SC member will serve out the remainder of the term for
the person they are replacing, regardless of the length of that remainder.

## Changes to the charter

Changes to this charter may be proposed via a PR on the charter itself.
Amendments are accepted with majority consent of the committee as per the
[decision process](#decision-process) outlined above.

Proposals and amendments to the charter are available for at least a period of
one week for comments and questions before a vote will occur.

## Authority, Facilitation, and Decision Making

Ideally most decisions will be made at the lowest possible level within the
project: within individual working groups. When this is not possible, Steering
can help facilitate a conversation to work through the contended issue. When
facilitation by the SC does not resolve the contention, the SC may have to
make a decision.

Note that if the committee is called to resolve contended decisions regularly, it is a
symptom of a larger problem in the community that will need to be addressed.
