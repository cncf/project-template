This [template repository][template-repo] by [CNCF SIG Contributor
Strategy][contrib-strat] helps new projects join CNCF. It provides a standardized structure and starter files to quickly set up a repository following community best practices.

By creating a copy and customizing the template, projects can focus on their unique goals instead of reinventing the wheel. Overall, it makes adopting CNCF guidelines and resources easier so projects can start strong.

## Getting Started 

To create a new project repository from this CNCF template:

1. Click **'Use this template'** below and create a copy of this repository under your own organization.

    [![Green button that says "Use this template"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1368985/95903529-e9c32f00-0d5b-11eb-8723-4369f7c9e044.png)](https://github.com/new?template_name=project-template&template_owner=cncf)

2. Remove `.github/settings.yml` - this contains configuration specific to for our repo only. You should not keep this file.

3. Customize every [required template](#required-templates) files and those specific to your project.

4. Remove any templates not needed.

5. Delete this top level README and rename [README-template.md](README-template.md) to README.md.

6. Update all references to `project`, `repo`, etc. Add links/badges specific to your project.

## Customizing the Template 

- ### Required Templates:

  - [LICENSE](LICENSE) - Replace with your project's license
  - [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Add project specific contribution guidelines
  - [README](README-template.md) - Use as starting point for your README

- Most files contain TODO comments with instructions on what needs to be changed. We recommend viewing the raw text or markdown source to see all the TODO comments.

- For example, in markdown files we use this syntax:

  `<!-- TODO: ... -->`

  to provide guidance and indicate where action is required. These TODO comments will not be visible when viewing the rendered markdown on GitHub, only in the raw text.

- Reviewing the raw files or enabling markdown rendering allows you to fully utilize the template by seeing all the customizable sections marked with TODOs.
